      <p className='star__description'>
        Alpha Centauri stands as one of the most intriguing systems in our galactic neighborhood. Comprising three
        stars—Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri—it offers a unique opportunity to study different
        stages of stellar evolution and the dynamics of multiple-star systems.

        Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our solar system, has long captivated astronomers as a potential host for
        habitable exoplanets. Webb&apos;s scrutiny of Proxima Centauri will delve into its stellar activity, unveiling
        insights into flares and magnetic fields. Such knowledge is crucial for assessing the habitability and potential
        existence of exoplanetary systems within its vicinity.

        The presence of multiple stars in the Alpha Centauri system offers a unique opportunity to study stellar
        evolution and the intricate dynamics of triple star systems. Webb&apos;s observations will help unravel the
        complex interactions between these stars, shedding light on their formation, evolution, and potential orbital
        resonances. These findings will enhance our understanding of star formation processes and the overall dynamics
        of stellar systems.
